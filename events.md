  <h2>International Energy Workshop 2025 – Nara, Japan</h2>
  <p>
    The International Energy Workshop (IEW) is one of the leading conferences for the international energy modeling research community. In a world of environmental and economic constraints, energy modeling is an increasingly important tool for addressing the complexity of energy planning and policy making. I have presented an energy system modelling research titled - <em> "PyPSA-BD For Strategic Power Sector Planning In Bangladesh With Gradual Renewable Energy Penetration, End-use Enhanced Efficiency And Demand-side Flexibility" </em>

  <h2>ADB Youth Capacity Workshop – Bangkok, February 2025</h2>
  <p>
    Led the <strong>winner team</strong> at the <em>ADB Youth Capacity Workshop on Developing Youth Solutions for Urban Climate Resilience</em>, held on 
    <strong>27–28 February 2025</strong> at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Thailand Resident Mission in Bangkok.
  </p>
  <p>
    The workshop brought together young professionals and researchers from institutions across Thailand to co-develop 
    practical climate resilience solutions for urban areas, with a particular focus on challenges facing Bangkok City. 
    As team lead, I guided the development of <strong>Eco-Cooler</strong> — a sustainable, low-cost cooling solution using 
    nature-based designs and upcycled materials to help outdoor workers adapt to extreme heat conditions. The solution was awarded <strong>first place</strong> 
    among six teams, recognized for its innovation, scalability, 
    and potential impact on urban climate adaptation.
