  Energy Equity And Transition For The Global South (EET - GS LAB)
</h1>


<p>
  The <strong>EET-GS Lab</strong> is a global research initiative dedicated to advancing equitable, sustainable, 
  and scientifically rigorous pathways for the <strong>energy transition across the Global South</strong>. 
  Our mission is to generate knowledge, tools, and evidence that support emerging economies as they move toward 
  <strong>clean, affordable, and resilient power systems</strong>—without compromising developmental priorities.
</p>

<p>
  A core focus of the Lab is ensuring that energy transitions are <strong>fair and just</strong>. 
  We examine how shifts in the power sector affect different social groups, identifying who benefits, who may be left behind, 
  and what policies are needed to safeguard vulnerable communities. 
  Our work integrates perspectives on <strong><a href="https://www.aceee.org/topic/energy-equity" target="_blank">energy equity</a></strong>, 
  <strong><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/distributive-justice" target="_blank">distributional justice</a></strong>, 
  and <strong>socio-economic impacts</strong>, ensuring that decarbonization strategies enhance livelihoods, 
  improve access, and contribute to <strong>inclusive development</strong> across the Global South.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, we explore how resilient power systems—systems that remain robust even under stress—can support a just transition.  
  Our resilience research considers technical, economic, and social dimensions, aligning with best practices such as those described in the <a href="https://cse.cigre.org/cse-n030/power-system-resilience-definition-features-and-properties.html" target="_blank">CIGRÉ-CSE resilience framework</a>.
</p>


<p>
The Lab brings together researchers, practitioners, and collaborators across the globe.  
Through interdisciplinary work, we explore how equitable policies, system modeling, and low-carbon technologies 
can shape a more just and sustainable energy future.
